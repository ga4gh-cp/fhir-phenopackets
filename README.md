Phenopackets on FHIR
==================

This FHIR implementation guide has been produced as part of the [GA4GH](https://ga4gh.org) [Clinical Phenotype Data Capture Workstream](https://ga4gh-cp.github.io/).

It is based on the [Phenopackets standard](https://phenopackets-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and uses the [Clinical Genomics Reporting FHIR implementation guide](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/).

Documentation
=============

This project contains the source code for the implementation guide. The website generate from this project can be found [here](https://aehrc.github.io/fhir-phenopackets-ig/).

Building
=================

There are several steps required to build the implementation guide. These will vary depending on the OS. This guide shows hoe to build in OSX.

1. Compile the FHIR Shorthand source

```
sushi .
```

2. Update the publisher. This needs to be done only the first time you are building the project.

```
cd build
./_updatePublisher.sh
```

3. Fix the output generated by Sushi (required until Sushi fixes [this issue](https://github.com/FHIR/sushi/issues/207)) and run the IG publisher.

```
cd ..
./build.sh
```
