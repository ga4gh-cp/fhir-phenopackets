The possible values for GenomicsReport.result:overall are: Inconclusive, Positive, Negative and Failure. UNKNOWN maps to Inconclusive, SOLVED maps to Positive, and UNSOLVED maps to Negative. IN\_PROGRESS refers to the status of the report, not su much about the actual result. This would map to the DiagnosticReport.status attribute with values _registered_ or _partial_. |
| phenopacket\_or\_family    | GenomicsReport.subject and an [extension](StructureDefinition-interpretation-phenopacket.html)                     | If the subject is a Phenopacket then the subject of the genomics report will be an individual and the actual Phenopacket will be linked from the Phenopacket extension. If the subject is a family then the extension is not needed because the Phenopackets of each member are already linked from the family resource.            |

The possible values for GenomicsReport.result:InheritedDiseasePathogenicity.value are: Benign, Likely benign, Uncertain significance, Likely pathogenic and Pathogenic. UNKNOWN maps to Uncertain significance, REJECTED maps to Benign, CANDIDATE maps to Likely pathogenic and CAUSATIVE maps to Pathogenic. |
